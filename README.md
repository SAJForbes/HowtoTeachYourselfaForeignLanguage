Hello and welcome to the repository for Teach Yourself a Foreign Language. Here you can find an Anki deck of the card types I use, which is a supplement to the Flashcards chapter.

The book is available now for purchase using a pay-what-you want model on Leanpub: https://leanpub.com/howtoteachyourselfaforeignlanguage

If you'd like to make a voluntary donation, separate from the book purchase, please consider buying me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/sajforbes

I offer 1 on 1 language coaching sessions as a thank you for anyone who donates over a certain amount, a perk you can find on my store at buymeacoffee.
